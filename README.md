## Overview

ChatterPay is a platform designed to facilitate seamless transactions in the crypto space. This subgraph specifically focuses on tracking deposits made by non-Chatters to ChatterPay accounts. By utilizing The Graph protocol, we can efficiently index and query blockchain data.

## Features

- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitor deposits as they happen.
- **User-Friendly Queries**: Access data easily with GraphQL.
- **Decentralized Architecture**: Built on a secure and transparent network.
- **Support for Multiple Tokens**: Works with USDT, WBTC, WETH, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **The Graph**: For indexing and querying blockchain data.
- **TypeScript**: For building a robust and maintainable codebase.
- **Scroll Network**: A layer 2 solution for Ethereum.
- **Account Abstraction**: Enhances user experience by simplifying wallet interactions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the ChatterPay Subgraph, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Stej13Dd/ChatterPay-Subgraph-Deposits.git
   cd ChatterPay-Subgraph-Deposits
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Deploy the Subgraph**:
   You can deploy the subgraph using the following command:
   ```bash
   graph deploy <YOUR_SUBGRAPH_NAME>
   ```

4. **Run the Subgraph**:
   To run the subgraph locally, use:
   ```bash
   graph codegen
   graph build

   ```

## Usage

Once the subgraph is running, you can query it using GraphQL. Here are some example queries:

### Fetch All Deposits

```graphql
{
  deposits {
    id
    amount
    token
    timestamp
  }
}
```

### Fetch Deposits by User

```graphql
{
  deposits(where: { user: "0x1234567890abcdef" }) {
    id
    amount
    token
    timestamp
  }
}
```
